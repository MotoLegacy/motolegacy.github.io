Blow up the power sources keeping that door shut!<br><br>Nuketown: Remastered is a recreation of Nuketown from BO2 as a base, and then expands drastically of the original map including being able to access the outside map houses & gardens, being able to unlock the bunker (which is far larger than the original Nuketown itself.)<br><br>The map itself took me over a year to map. Also Ege115 essentially brought the map together with scripting, adding weapons, fixing bugs and so much more for months on end.<br><br><a style="color: red; font-size: 24px">Fixes and changes in Nuketown Remastered 1.1:</a></p><ul class=content_list><li>Changed it so you can now both have the rake trap and the zombie shield in your inventory<li>Changed it so you can have the normal ray gun and the not upgraded one when you go down with QR on solo.<li>Fixed the vision glitch that happens when the map restarts automatically after dying on solo. And no more black and white vision after taking a Time Warp powerup.<li>Fixed a hole in the ground where you could see through the map in the yello whouse garden next to where a shield part can be.<li>Fixed the game breaking glitch that made you get stuck on the ramp by Deadshot Daiquiri<li>Fixed Mule Kick in coop where if you went down and someone revived you, you'd still keep your third gun. And then afterwards get unlimited guns.<li>Fixed an issue where zombies start spawning in the blue house without actually opening to the blue house. The blue house will only have 1 debris so the zombies can get out of the house in some way.<li>Fixed some places where powerups could spawn outsize the map where you killed zombies.<li>Added a clip to a wooden pole under the outside stairs of the yellow house.</ul><br><br><p class=content_description><a style="color: red; font-size: 24px">Fixes and changes in Nuketown Remastered 1.2:</a></p><ul class=content_list><li>The zombie spawning is improved, the map is now harder and more hectic!<li>Fixed the out of map exploit in the house by deadshot daiquiri<li>Fixed an open window that you couldn't shoot through.<li>Fixed another spot where powerups could spawn outside the map.<li>Fixed a bug were the game could crash if you're in laststand and try go with the zipline/watershoot/escape truck in the EE.<li>Fixed a bug were you couldn't melee when holding the MK-11<li>Added the correct ammo stats for the upgraded PPSH-41.<li>Buffed galvaknuckles so it's 1 hit kill up to 15, before it was round 14.<li>Added more traverses for zombies to get to you.</ul></p><br><br><p class=content_header> Screenshots </p><br><div class=content_forcecenter><div class=content_gallery><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_0.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_1.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_2.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_3.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_4.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_5.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_6.jpg></div><button class="content_gallery_btn content_gallery_btn_next"> > </button><button class="content_gallery_btn content_gallery_btn_prev"><</button></div></div><br><br><br></div><div style="background-color: black; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><br><center><h3 style="font-family: 'Nevermind'; color: white;"> Thrown together in a day by ivy.dev/MotoLegacy/cypressimplex.

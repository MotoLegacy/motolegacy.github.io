I basically took as many weapons as i had from cod4 and weapons from other cods like blops and mw2. i skipped over WaW abit since those have been seen alot. i also didn’t repeat weapons like i didn’t add cod4, blops and mw2 ak47s.This is the most weapons ive ever added into one map, and im only about a gun or 2 from hitting WaW’s limit<br>============================================================<br>-Music box<br> -8 songs including Carry on by Avenge Sevenfold<br>-Tons of weapons, probably the most ever seen in one map<br>-Black ops and other cod guns never seen in a TMG map yet<br>-New, resigned Quizz nades and uber-nades<br>-Auto turrets<br>-Winnable ending<br>-new Teddy power drop<br>-some pretty cool Easter Eggs, if i do say so myself :D<br>============================================================<br>To fix the 4011.2MB Error, Make sure you have the following options ON/OFF:<br>textures Filtering and texture quality set to Automatic.<br>specular maps: ON<br>steam overlay: OFF (Only if using steam)<br>then fully restart your WaW .<br>That should fix the issue. if not pm me! do not comment here.<br><br>And a huge thanks to CFGfactory.com, if it wasn’t for this site we wouldn’t have such awesome weapons :) </p><br><br><p class=content_header> Screenshots </p><br><div class=content_forcecenter><div class=content_gallery><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_0.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_1.jpg></div><div class=content_screenshot><img src=shot_2.jpg></div><button class="content_gallery_btn content_gallery_btn_next"> > </button><button class="content_gallery_btn content_gallery_btn_prev"><</button></div></div><br><br><br></div><div style="background-color: black; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><br><center><h3 style="font-family: 'Nevermind'; color: white;"> Thrown together in a day by ivy.dev/MotoLegacy/cypressimplex.
